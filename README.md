# HTB-intelligence-brute-forcer

```brute-forcer.py``` is a simple Python script that will enumerate all PDF files on the HTB's Intelligence Machine Website. This script will download all PDF files if you want to enumerate them directly from the machine, but it will also provide a URL to the PDF file if you prefer a browser preview. 
Finally, it will create users.txt with all PDF Creators extracted from the PDF's metadata so you can conduct *Pass the Password* attack for further enumeration.
